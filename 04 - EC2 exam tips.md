EC2 is one of the most important technologies that you need to know going into your exam. So let's review everything that we learned about EC2. So what is EC2? Well, it's like a virtual machine. It's hosted in AWS instead of your own data center. And you basically select the capacity that you need right now, and you can grow and shrink when you need to. and you only pay for what you use. And it takes only minutes to provision an EC2 instance, not months. So let's look at our four different EC2 instance pricing options. And you will be given scenario-based questions. And there will be quite a few of them. And you have to select the best pricing. So let's start with on-demand. This is where you pay by the second or the hour, depending on the type of instance that you run. And it's great for flexibility, no long-term contracts, et cetera, et cetera. Spot - this is where you purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90% and the prices fluctuate with supply and demand. It's great for applications with flexible start and end times. Reserve instances - this is where you reserve your capacity for 1-3 years. The more you pay upfront the greater savings you have. You can save up to 72% discount on the hourly charge. This is great if you've got known or fix requirements. And then finally, we've got dedicated. And this is a physical EC2 server that's dedicated for your use. And it's great if you have server bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements. So perhaps government says that you can't do it on multi-tenant hardware, then you want dedicated instances. So you are going to probably get at least four different scenario based questions each where you have to select the right pricing option, and you will have to select basically these four. So make sure you know what the different pricing options are going into your exam and what their use cases are. Moving on to the command line, so the AWS command line interface. So we learned that you should always give your users least privilege. So when we created our group, we basically didn't give them administrative privileges, we just gave them S3 administrative privilege. So you always give your users the minimum amount of access required to do their jobs. And you should always use groups. You should create IAM groups and assign your users to groups. And group permissions are assigned using IAM policy documents. And your users will automatically inherit the permissions of the group. So as soon as you add a user into the group, that's where they're going to inherit the permissions from that group. Staying on the command line, just remember these important AWS CLI tips. So your secret access key, you'll only ever see this once. If you lose it, you can delete the access key ID and secret access key and regenerate them. But you're going to need to run the AWS configure again and enter in your secret access key as well as your access key ID. Don't share your key pairs. So each developer should have their own access key ID and secret access key. So just like usernames and passwords, you shouldn't be shared. You should always have one key pair per human user. Remember that the command line is supported by Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. You can install the CLI on your Mac, Linux, or Windows PC, and you can also use it on EC2 instances. Moving on to roles. So roles are the preferred option. If you can use roles from a security perspective, then you should. Avoid hard coding your credentials with roles. You don't need to save access key IDs and secret access keys into your code in order to be able to access things like S3 from EC2. Instead, you can basically create a role and that allows you to use other AWS services without the use of access key IDs and secret access keys. We then have policies. So policies control a role's permission, just like policies control your user permissions and group permissions. So it's exactly the same thing. And in terms of updates, you can update a policy and attach it to a role and it will take effect immediately. Attaching and detaching, you can attach and detach a role to a running EC2 instance without having to stop or terminate these instances. Moving on to security groups. Just remember that when you create a security group and you make a change to the security group, perhaps you add port 80 or port 443, those changes will take effect immediately. You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group and you can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances. Remember that when you create a security group, all inbound traffic is blocked by default and all outbound traffic is allowed. And moving on to Bootstrap scripts. So Bootstrap script is a script that runs when the instance first runs. It runs at root level, so it has full administrative privileges and it passes user data to the EC2 instance and can be used to install applications like our web servers, database servers, as well as do updates and whatever else you want it to do when you first boot that EC2 instance. Now you will get a bunch of scenario questions where they're trying to confuse you with user data and metadata. So if you remember, user data is simply your bootstrap scripts, whereas metadata is data about your EC2 instances. And you can use bootstrap scripts or user data to access metadata. And that's what we did in that lab. We basically ran a bootstrap script which got our public IP4 address, and it made a little webpage telling us what that IPv4 address is. Moving on to networking with EC2. So you're going to get different scenarios on the exam and you'll be asked to choose the correct networking device. You need to understand the three different networking devices and what their use cases are. So E&I for example, this is for basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network from your production network or a separate logging network or maybe even something to monitor. So you need it separate from your production network and you need to do this at low cost So in this case, you just are going to use multiple elastic network interfaces for each network Enhanced networking. This is for when you need speeds between 10 gigabits per second and 100 gigabits per second Basically anywhere you need reliable and high throughput and then EFAs This is where you need to have high performance computing and machine learning applications or you need to do an OS level bypass. If you see a scenario question talking about HPC or machine learning and asking what network adapting adapter you should use, then you want to choose EFA, elastic fabric adapter, moving on to our different types of placement groups. So placement group is just a logical grouping of EC2 instances. You can have cluster placement groups. This is where you need low network latency and high network throughput. again for high performance computing. Spread placement groups, this is where you have basically key critical EC2 instances and you don't want them to be on the same hardware, so you need to spread them around and then we've got our partition placement groups and this is where you've got multiple EC2 instances, things like HDFS, HBase and Cassandra. So if you see any scenario based questions talking about those technologies, you wanna put them on partition placement groups. Moving on, things to remember for the exam about placement groups, our cluster placement groups can't span multiple availability zones where a spread placement group and partition placement group can. Only certain types of instances can be launched into placement groups. So this will be compute optimized, GPU optimized, memory optimized, and storage optimized. AWS always recommends homogenous instances with clustered placement groups. And you can't merge placement groups. you can move an existing instance into a placement group before you move the instance. The instance must be in the stop state. You can then move or remove an instance using the AWS CLI or the SDK, but you can't do it via the console just yet. So moving on to dedicated hosts. So any question that you see that talks about special licensing requirements or maybe even compliance requirements, I want you to think of dedicated hosts. And Amazon EC2 dedicated host is a physical server with an EC2 instance capacity that's fully dedicated for your use. It's not shared hardware. So dedicated hosts allow you to use your existing per socket, per call, per VM software licenses, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and Suse Linux Enterprise Server. Remember with spot instances and spot fleets, that spot instances can save you up to 90% of the cost of on-demand instances. You can block spot instances from terminating by using spot block. And it's useful for any type of computing where you don't need persistent storage. And then a spot fleet is a collection of spot instances and optionally on demand instances. Moving on to some newer topics that were introduced recently to the exam. So you can deploy the center on AWS, uh, using VMware. And this is basically the perfect solution for extending your private VMware cloud onto the AWS public cloud. And a common scenario for this might be things like cloud migration or just basically doing disaster recovery using AWS, but you want all the native tools that come with VMware and within vCenter itself. So you can definitely do that. And then the last one is just about AWS Outposts. So if you get to see a scenario question about extending AWS to your data center, just think of AWS Outposts. It's bringing AWS to you. And essentially there's two different family members. There's AWS Outposts racks. This is for large deployments. So these are 42U form factor racks that will go inside a data center. Whereas AWS Outposts servers are for smaller deployments. So this will be things like putting in a one-use server inside a retail shop, for example. So that is it for this lecture, everyone. I hope you've had lots of fun learning about EC2. If you have any questions, please let me know. If not, feel free to move on to the next section.

Sure, here is a tabular representation of EC2 placement groups with details and specifications:


| EC2 Placement Group | Details and Specifications |
| --- | --- |
| Cluster Placement Group | All instances are placed within a single Availability Zone and provide low network latency and high network throughput, ideal for high-performance computing (HPC) |
| Spread Placement Group | Instances are spread across underlying hardware to reduce the risk of simultaneous failure, ideal for critical applications where high availability is required |
| Partition Placement Group | Instances are spread across partitions that are within a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones, ideal for distributed and replicated workloads such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra |
| Limitations | Cluster Placement Groups cannot span multiple Availability Zones, only certain instance types are supported (Compute Optimized, GPU Optimized, Memory Optimized, and Storage Optimized), homogenous instances are recommended for best performance |
| Best Practices | Partition Placement Groups should be used for distributed and replicated workloads, Spread Placement Groups should be used for critical applications where high availability is required, Cluster Placement Groups should be used for high-performance computing, and homogeneous instances are recommended for best performance. |


Understanding the different types of placement groups, their limitations, and best practices is essential for designing and deploying EC2 instances in an optimized and efficient manner.
