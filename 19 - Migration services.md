Let's have a quick run through of some migration exam tips to reinforce what we've just learned. Four questions to ask yourself in the exam. First, where are we going? Are we moving data from on-premise to AWS, from AWS to on-prem? Are we moving between Cloud vendors or even to a third party SaaS from AWS? There are many different options and scenarios that can come up, so be sure to distinguish what the source is and what the destination is. Secondly, how do we get there? Do we use Snowball devices to do a bulk upload to Amazon? Or do we use a migration service like AWS DMS to migrate our database in chunks? Building off of that, is it all at once? So again, do we leverage a Snowball device to move all of our data in one big move? Or do we migrate in small increments using replication for our servers in AWS? There are many different ways you can go, so be sure you understand the true use case in the scenario. And then finally, is it a partial migration? So if it's not all at once, how do we want to partially migrate this? Do we want to just use a basic S3 upload? Do we want to use multi-part upload? Do we want to use a service for server replication? or do we want to just lift and shift everything all at once? These are four important questions you should ask yourself within scenarios that you see on the exam. So the first thing we want to talk about is migrating data with the AWS Snow Family. What should you know? Well, firstly, snowball choices are really going to be based on how much data you're moving. It's good to know that snowballs are perfect for moving many terabytes of data. So if you don't want to hog up all of your bandwidth on your network, you can use Snowballs instead and offload that storage migration to a device and then load that into Amazon S3 by shipping them your Snowball devices. Now Snowcone and Snowmobile are likely not to be on the exam as much as Snowball itself, but it's good to know just enough of a general overview for both of these services. And then lastly, when do we actually use Snowball? it's best used in situations where you have slow to no internet. So think about that scenario I just gave you about not wanting to hog up all of your network bandwidth by uploading all of that data. In that case, you can use a snowball to be much more efficient. Snowball is going to be faster and more secure in a lot of these situations. Let's move on to three exam tips for storage gateway. The first is a hybrid. Anytime you you have on-premise storage, think which version of Storage Gateway could complement this. So if I need to store my data in S3, but I also need access to it on-prem in a quick or easy manner, think which Storage Gateway would I use. Another scenario is, are you out of space? File Gateway is a perfect solution if your local network attached storage is already full. this easily allows you to leverage AWS storage like you would any other local network attached storage device. And thirdly, it's a VM. So storage gateway is run locally as a virtual machine on-premise. You deploy the template file, you connect it to your storage solution in Amazon, likely S3, and then you can connect to it locally within all of your virtual machines. Now let's move on to data sync in the transfer family. Data sync is an agent-based solution that excels at one-time migration of file shares into AWS. So if you have files that live on-prem but you need to shift them all into Amazon and be done with the on-premise solution, then data sync is likely a good choice. Next we have EFS and FSx. These are both viable locations for data sync to transfer content into. And remember which one you would use for your particular operating system. That comes up quite a bit. And thirdly, the transfer family is going to allow you to use legacy file transfer protocols, so think SFTP, to give older applications the ability to read and write from S3 buckets. It abstracts the API calls and turns it into a legacy file transfer protocol. Let's move on to moving to the cloud with Migration Hub. Remember, Migration Hub is an organizational tool that's giving you a way to organize all of your migration steps. However, you will need other tools to complete the migration. It doesn't do it for you, it just helps you organize and track. The Database Migration Service is going to be your go-to tool for any sort of database migration. It works for both on-premise to the cloud or for even moving data between different RDS databases. And remember it provides you that powerful tool known as the AWS schema conversion tool. Lastly, do you have VMs? If so, Server Migration Service is going to be the tool that you'll want to use in order to migrate out of the data center and then into AWS. Now that we have those covered, let's quickly talk about the Application Discovery service. This is going to allow you to quickly migrate entire applications to the cloud. And it does so by Discovery. There's Agentless Discovery which can be used via an OVA template file that's deployed to vSphere. You can also do an Agent-based Discovery which uses obviously an agent and it collects detailed information of your VMs on both Linux and Windows operating systems. So just remember, if you need to discover and collect detailed information, think Application Discovery Service. The next service is the Application Migration Service. Now this service is commonly referred to as AWS-MGN. And what it offers is an automated lift and shift service for you to migrate all of your infrastructure into the AWS cloud. What it does is it allows you to replicate your source servers, and these can be things like basic VMs, they can be physical servers, they can even be Azure VMs in the Azure cloud. And it replicates them into AWS for a non-disruptive cutover. And remember, there's a very impressive RTO and RPO. It's an RTO of mere minutes based on boot time of the operating systems and the RPO is subseconds. So it's very fast and it allows you for immediate recovery essentially. Now that'll do it for these exam tips. Per usual, all of the references for these lessons are available at the documentation within the AWS sites and you can see those listed here. Now let's go ahead, we'll take a break, stretch, get a glass of water, and when you're ready, we'll pick back up with the next section.

> list all the snow family services in tabular way

Here are all the services in the AWS Snow Family in a tabular way:


| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AWS Snowcone | Small, rugged, and portable device for remote or disconnected locations. Can store up to 8 TB of data. |
| AWS Snowball | Large, rugged, and portable device for moving large amounts of data into and out of AWS. Available in two sizes: 50 TB and 80 TB. |
| AWS Snowmobile | Largest member of the Snow Family, with a capacity of up to 100 PB. Housed in a shipping container and transported to your location for massive data migrations. |


Each service in the AWS Snow Family has unique features and use cases, but all are designed to help organizations securely and efficiently move large amounts of data into and out of AWS.

> list all the Database Migration Service in tabular way

Here are all the services in the AWS Database Migration Service in a tabular way:


| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AWS Database Migration Service | A fully managed service that enables you to migrate databases to AWS easily and securely. Works with various source and target database engines, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others. |
| AWS Schema Conversion Tool | A standalone tool that helps convert database schema and code from one database engine to another. Can be used independently or with the AWS Database Migration Service. |
| AWS Database Migration Service Replication Instance | An EC2 instance that runs the replication software for the AWS Database Migration Service. Can be created and managed through the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. |


These services in the AWS Database Migration Service are designed to help you easily migrate your databases to AWS, regardless of your source or target database engines. The AWS Schema Conversion Tool is particularly useful in converting database schema and code to ensure compatibility with the target database engine. The Replication Instance is used to run the replication software for the AWS Database Migration Service, allowing you to replicate your database to the target engine with minimal downtime.
