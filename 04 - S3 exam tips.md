> Okay, well congratulations everyone you have made it through the S3 section of the course. So in this lecture we're just going to summarize everything that we learnt in this section of the course. So going into your exam, just remember that S3 is object based storage, it allows you to upload and store files in the cloud. It's not suitable for operating systems or database storage, so you can't just go in and store Windows or Linux or run a MySQL database on S3. It's suitable for files that are up to five terabytes in size. Your files can be anywhere from zero bytes to five terabytes, and you get unlimited storage. So the total volume of data and the number of objects you can store within S3 is unlimited. Remember that files are stored in buckets, and that S3 is a universal namespace. So all the universal namespace means is you're not allowed to have the same bucket name as other people. And when you create a bucket, it's always going to have the bucket name in the URL. In this example, we've got a cloud guru, then .s3, then .theregions, so it could be us.east1, and then .amazonaws.com, and then forward slash the key name, and the key name is just the file names. It could be Ralphie.jpg. And remember that when you upload files to S3, your browser always get a HTTP 200 status code. Moving on to our S3 object tips, just remember that the key is the object name, So it's the file names, so Ralphie.jpg. The value is the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes. We then have our version ID. We looked at that when we were doing versioning, and this allows you to have multiple versions of the same object. And then we always have metadata in S3, and this is just data about your data. So data about the data that you're storing. So it could be the content type, for example, if it's an image or when it was last modified, et cetera. So moving on to securing your buckets with S3, Remember that S3 buckets are private by default. When you create an S3 buckets private and all the objects within it are private and you have to go in and allow public access on both the bucket and its objects in order to make the bucket public. Remember that you have object ACLs and this is basically access control lists that you apply on individual objects using object ACLs. This is a way of giving permissions to make individual objects public or you could put an object ACL saying you're not allowed to delete this object. We then have bucket policies. Bucket policies are bucket-wide policies. So you can make entire buckets public using bucket policies. And I've already covered this off, but like I said, when you upload an object to S3 and it's successful, you always get a HTTP 200 status code. Remember that you can host a static website with S3. You do this using bucket policies as best practice. So basically you create a bucket policy that makes every object within your bucket public. And this is basically used just for static content. It's not used for dynamic content. So if you need a database connection using S3, you don't wanna run your websites in S3, you then use something like EC2. So it's static content only. And remember that S3 automatically scales with demands. You don't have to worry about things like load balances, et cetera. S3 is a great place to store your static websites with. So moving on to versioning. So we looked at how we can use versioning with our S3 buckets, and all versions of an object are going to be stored in S3. This includes all rights. So we have our webpage where we had version one, version two, version three. And even if you delete an object, all that's doing is placing a delete marker over that object version. And then you can basically remove this by deleting the delete marker. So versioning can be a great backup tool. It can't be disabled. Once you turn versioning on, it can only be suspended, you can't go in and turn it off. And just remember you can use versioning with lifecycle rules, so you can integrate it with lifecycle rules, so you can basically move your older versions to different storage tiers, and it supports multi-factor authentication as well. Moving on to our different storage tiers, this will come up an awful lot in your exam. Just know there's six different storage tiers, and know they're different use cases. So S3 standard is suitable for most workloads, so websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications. S3 standard infrequently accessed is good for long-term infrequently accessed, but critical data, so this could be a backup, so your data store for your disaster recovery, et cetera. S3 one zone infrequent access is great for long-term infrequently accessed, but non-critical data, because it is only going to be in one availability zone. And they might even give you scenario questions where it says company policy dictates that it must be stored in at least two or more availability zones, then straight away you can rule out S3 one zone infrequently access storage as a storage class in that scenario. We then have Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive. Just remember the retrieval times. So essentially if you need it before 12 hours, then you want S3 Glacier. If you're okay to wait an average of 12 hours or more, then you want Deep Archive. If you wanna save the most money, then of course you always want deep archive. And then we have a S3 Intelligent Tearing. This basically just uses machine learning to move your objects between the different tiers to save you the most amount of money and it's used for unknown or unpredictable access patterns. So moving on to lifecycle management. So three tips for lifecycle management. This basically automates the moving of your objects between the different storage tiers. It can be used in conjunction with versioning and it can be applied to current versions and previous versions of your object. We then looked at S3 object lock to store objects using a write once read many model. So as soon as you see the term worm and it's talking about S3, I want you to think of S3 object lock. And this can be on individual objects or applied across the bucket as a whole. And it always comes in two modes. It comes in governance mode and compliance mode. And just a gentle reminder of what each one of those is. So with governance mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object version after it's lock settings, unless they have special permission. So you can do it with certain number of users. But if you need to ban all users from being able to access or to be able to write and delete those objects, then you want compliance mode. This basically stops anyone from doing it, including the root account or the root user within your AWS account. If you see a worm model, but it's not talking about S3, it's talking about Glacier, then you want S3 Glacier Vault Lock. This allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. And you can specify controls such as a worm model in a Vault Lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. And once locked, the policy can no longer be changed. Moving on to encryption with S3. So we had two different types of ways we can encrypt data. First of all is sending the data to S3. So this is encryption in transit. So we can encrypt our data using SSL or using HTTPS. So whenever you visit S3 using your browser, you're going to visit using HTTPS. And that means all the objects that you send to S3 will be encrypted in transit. We then have encryption at rest using server-side encryption. So that's all SSE stands for is server-side encryption. And it comes in three different flavors. We've got server-side encryption with S3, and this is using the AES 256-bit encryption algorithm. So this is where Amazon handles all of the encryption on our behalf for us using the S3 service. We can then also use a external service from S3, which is key management service to encrypt our data as well. And then we've also got it where the customer handles the keys themselves. So this is S-S-E-C. Then we've got client side encryption, and this is basically where you just encrypt the files yourself before you upload them to S3. And you can enforce encryption with a bucket policy. So bucket policy can deny all put requests that don't include the XAME server side encryption parameter in the request header. Moving on to optimizing performance with S3. So we looked at prefixes. So prefixes is simply the folder and then subfolder within a S3 bucket. So in this example, we've got folder one and then subfolder one, that is one prefix. Remember that you can achieve a high number of requests. So 3500 put copy post deletes and then 5500 get and header requests per second per prefix. And of course, the more prefixes you have, the better performance that you get. So if you have two prefixes, so two different prefixes, you could then achieve an 11,000 requests per second for any get requests because it's spread over two prefixes. If you did it across four prefixes, you're gonna be getting 22,000 requests per second. So that's all prefixes are. Just think of prefixes as folders and subfolders within S3. The more of them that you have, the better performance that you get. Also remember that if you're using SSC, server-side encryption KMS to encrypt your objects in S3, you must keep in mind that there are built-in limits. The built-in limits are region specific, but it's either gonna be 5,500, 10,000, or 30,000 requests per second. Uploading and downloading is always going to count towards your KMS quota, and currently you can't request an increase for KMS. Remember, if we want to optimize our performance, we can use multi-part uploads to increase performance when uploading to S3. This should be used for any files over 100 megs, but it must be used for any file over five gigs. And similarly, if we are downloading data, we can use S3 byte range fetches to increase performance to download our files from S3. And this is basically just splitting the files into smaller versions and then parallelizing the downloads. And then finally, moving on to S3 replication. Just remember what S3 replication is. This is where you can replicate objects from one bucket to another. It used to be that you would do this across regions. So if the exam questions haven't been updated, they could call it cross region replication, but you can also do it to buckets in the same region as well as different regions. Just remember when you turn this on that objects in an existing bucket are not going to be replicated automatically. And by default, delete markers are not replicated automatically from one bucket to another, but you can turn that on as an option. So that is it for this section. You've done really, really well. We're gonna move on to EC2, which is one of the bread and butter services of AWS. It's a huge topic in the exam. And it's basically just where you provision virtual machines in the cloud. So if you've got the time, please join me in the next section. Thank you. \[MUSIC\]

Sure, here's a table outlining the different types of S3 storage classes along with their key characteristics:


| Storage Class | Description | Suitable Use Cases | Minimum Storage Duration | Minimum Object Size | Retrieval Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S3 Standard | General-purpose storage with low latency and high throughput | Websites, big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications | N/A | N/A | Immediate |
| S3 Standard-Infrequent Access | Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data | Disaster recovery, backups, archives, long-term storage | 30 days | N/A | Immediate |
| S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access | Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data in one zone | Secondary backup copies, easily reproducible data | 30 days | N/A | Immediate |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering | Automatically moves data to the most cost-effective tier | Unknown or unpredictable access patterns, long-term data | 30 days | N/A | Immediate |
| S3 Glacier | Low-cost storage for data archiving | Compliance data, long-term data retention | 90 days | 0 bytes | Minutes to hours (standard) |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive | Lowest-cost storage for long-term data archiving | Compliance data, legal archives, digital preservation projects | 180 days | 0 bytes | 12 hours to 48 hours (standard) |


Note: Retrieval times for Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive can be reduced by using expedited or bulk retrievals, which have higher costs than standard retrievals.

It's important to note that the above table is just a brief summary of the different S3 storage classes and their key characteristics. It's recommended to refer to the AWS documentation for more detailed information and up-to-date pricing information.
