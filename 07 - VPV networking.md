> ACT AS a profesional writter and transcribe, fix the identation the following text: Okay, hello, Cloud Gurus and congratulations, you're at the end of the VPC section of the course. This is actually one of the more difficult sections, but if you know VPC inside out, then you're going to do very, very well on the exam. So let's go through what we learned in this section of the course. So just think of a VPC as a logical data center inside AWS. It consists of internet gateways or virtual private gateways, root tables, network access control lists, subnets, and security groups. Remember that one subnet is always in one availability zone. You can't have a subnet that spans multiple availability zones. And let's move on to NAT gateways. So we remember that it is redundant inside the availability zone, so you don't need to worry about that. It starts at 5 gigabits per second and scales currently to 45 gigabits per second. You'll never actually be quizzed about that on the exam, like its individual throughput levels, but just remember that it does give you sufficient network throughput. You don't need to go in and patch the operating system or anything for your NAT gateway, and it's not associated with any security groups. And it automatically is assigned a public IP address when you create it. Now in terms of high availability for NAT gateways, and this can be a very popular scenario-based If you have resources in multiple availability zones and they share a NAT gateway, in the event that that NAT gateway's availability zone is down, then the resources in the other availability zones are going to lose internet access. So to create an availability zone independent architecture, you need to create NAT gateways in each availability zone, and then you just need to configure your routing to ensure that the resources use the NAT gateway in the same availability zone. We looked at security groups and we learnt that they are stateful. If you send a request from your instance, the response traffic to that request is allowed to flow in regardless of the inbound security group rules. And responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out regardless of the outbound rules. We then looked at network ACLs. So when you create a VPC, you get a default network ACL automatically. And that by default also allows all inbound and outbound traffic. We can then go and create our own custom network ACLs. And we did this to basically create a custom network ACL that was public. So essentially anything that we associated with that network ACL would be publicly accessible via the internet. So by default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. so it's the opposite of your default network ACL. When you create a custom network ACL, by default it denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you go in and add those rules. We learned about subnet association, so each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, then that subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. And for that reason, you probably don't want your default network ACL to have a public route to the internet because it means as soon as you create a subnet that subnet is always going to be public. Remember you can also block IP addresses using network ACLs and you don't do that using security groups and that can be a common exam question or scenario based question. It will be talking about a hacker or something and you need to block access. What level do you do it at? Well, you always do that at the network ACL level. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets However, a subnet itself can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. So when you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed. Network ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order, starting with the lowest number first. And network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. And most importantly, just remember network ACLs are stateless. So responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic and vice versa. We then learned about direct connect and this is a way of directly connecting your data center to AWS. It's useful for high throughput workloads. So for example, lots of network traffic. And it's helpful for when you need a stable and reliable secure connection. So you will see scenario questions where they're talking about you've got a VPN connection keeps dropping out, you need a stable and reliable connection that can handle high throughput. I want you to think of Direct Connect. Moving on to VPC endpoints. So this is when you want to connect AWS services without leaving the Amazon's internal network. There's two types of VPC endpoints. There's interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. And gateway endpoints basically at the moment just support S3 and DynamoDB. Peering on to Peering, so this allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses. Instances behave as if they were on the same private network and you can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as other VPCs in the same account. Peering is always done in a star configuration, so this is a hub and spoke model. So you have one central VPC that peers with four others, you can't have transitive peering. You can peer VPCs between regions. And like I said, VPCs is just a way of one VPC being able to talk to another one. And here is a good network diagram of VPCs. If you want VPCB to talk to VPCC, and it's paired with VPCA, you can't do transitive peering, so you need to create a peering connection between VPCB and VPCC. Moving on to AWS Private Links. So if you see a question asking about peering VPCs to tens, hundreds and thousands of customer VPCs, I want you to think of AWS PrivateLink. It doesn't require VPC peering. There's no root tables, NAT gateways, internet gateways, et cetera, but it does require a network load balancer on the service VPC, and it requires an ENI on the customer VPC. Moving on to transit gateways. So you can use root tables to limit how VPCs talk to one another. Transit Gateway works with Direct Connect as well as VPN connections, and it supports IP multicast, which is basically a way of allowing a host to send a single packet to thousands of hosts across a rooted network. So for example, the internet, it's mostly used for audio, so radio, for example, as well as video distribution. Also going into the exam, if you just see a question about simplifying network topology, or they're talking about IP multicasting, just think of transit gateway. Transit gateway is fantastic technology that basically stops you from having to have all these different peering connections, et cetera, et cetera. You just set up transit gateway, you connect one thing to it at once, so it could be a VPN connection or a VPC peering connection or whatever, and then transit gateway will allow you to communicate directly to everything else. So it's just a way of simplifying your network topology. And the very last thing we learned about was securing your network with VPN hub. And this is essentially just a way of allowing your customers, let's say you've got an office in New York and you've got an office in Miami and you're connecting in through a VPN connection to your VPC hosted with AWS. If you use VPN hub, it means that you can basically have the New York office talk to Miami via the VPN hub. So again, it's a way of simplifying your VPN network topology. So if you see a scenario based question, where they're talking about that, how can you simplify your VPN network topology? I want you to think of VPN hub. And then finally, if you see any scenario based questions about mobile edge computing or 5G, and it will be about increasing your application speed at edge, then I want you to think of AWS wavelength. So that is it for this section of course, you've done really, really well. I would definitely before taking the exam, just try and build a VPC by yourself from memory. If you can do that, you're going to absolutely smash all the networking questions. So that's it for this section of the course. If you have any questions, please let me know. If not, feel free to move on to the next section.

> Explain, characteristics and details of Amazon VPC, including internet gateways, virtual private gateways, route tables, network access control lists, subnets, and security groups, in tabular way markdown sintax

Sure, here is a breakdown of the key characteristics and details of Amazon VPC and its related components:

```
| Component | Characteristics and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Amazon VPC | A logical data center inside AWS that enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network |
| Internet Gateway | A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet |
| Virtual Private Gateway | A component that allows you to establish secure and private connectivity between your VPC and on-premises or other remote networks |
| Route Tables | A set of rules that determine where network traffic is directed in your VPC, including the destination CIDR block, target gateway or instance, and associated status |
| Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) | A stateless firewall that controls traffic in and out of your VPC subnet, evaluated in order of their rule number, with separate inbound and outbound rules |
| Subnets | A range of IP addresses in your VPC that allows you to group instances based on security and operational needs, and map to a specific availability zone |
| Security Groups | A stateful firewall that controls traffic to your instances, evaluated in the order of their rules, with separate inbound and outbound rules |
```

These components work together to provide a secure and isolated environment for your AWS resources within a virtual network.

It is important to understand the basic functionality and configuration options of each component when designing and deploying solutions in Amazon VPC.

> explain in detail security groups and network ACLs, including their differences and how they are evaluated. in tabular way markdown sintax

Certainly, here is a breakdown of the key characteristics and differences between Security Groups and Network ACLs, including how they are evaluated:

```
| Component | Characteristics and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Security Groups | A stateful firewall that controls traffic to and from instances in your VPC. |
| Differences | Security groups are applied at the instance level, while network ACLs are applied at the subnet level. Security groups are stateful, meaning that they allow response traffic to flow back out, while network ACLs are stateless and require separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic. |
| Evaluation | Security groups are evaluated in the order of their rules, with separate inbound and outbound rules. They allow all traffic by default and only deny traffic explicitly specified in the rules. |
| Network ACLs | A stateless firewall that controls traffic in and out of subnets in your VPC. |
| Differences | Network ACLs are evaluated in the order of their rule number, with separate inbound and outbound rules. They deny all traffic by default and only allow traffic explicitly specified in the rules. |
| Evaluation | Network ACLs evaluate rules in the order of their rule number, with separate inbound and outbound rules. They allow or deny traffic based on the first rule that matches the traffic flow. |
```

It is important to understand the differences and evaluation processes of these two components when designing and securing solutions in Amazon VPC. Both Security Groups and Network ACLs can provide added layers of security to your resources, and it is common to use them together to create a defense-in-depth approach.

> explain AWS PrivateLink and its characteristics and how its works in tabular way

Sure, here is a breakdown of the key characteristics and functionality of AWS PrivateLink:

```
| Component | Characteristics and Details |
| --- | --- |
| AWS PrivateLink | A service that allows you to securely access services hosted on AWS, without requiring internet access, NAT devices, or VPN connections. |
| Functionality | AWS PrivateLink creates a private connection between the VPC of the consumer and the service VPC. This connection is created using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) with private IP addresses. |
| Supported Services | AWS PrivateLink supports access to many AWS services, including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and AWS Lambda. |
| Security | AWS PrivateLink uses AWS PrivateLink endpoints to provide a secure, private, and scalable solution. PrivateLink endpoints are owned and managed by the service provider, and the consumer does not need to perform any configuration on their end. |
| Benefits | AWS PrivateLink provides secure, reliable, and high-bandwidth connectivity between services, eliminates the need for public IP addresses, and allows for simplified network architecture. |
| Limitations | AWS PrivateLink requires that the service provider has enabled PrivateLink for their service, and that the consumer's VPC and the service VPC do not have overlapping IP ranges. |
```

It is important to understand the functionality and security benefits of AWS PrivateLink when designing and deploying solutions that require secure and private connectivity between AWS services. AWS PrivateLink can simplify network architecture and eliminate the need for complex VPN or NAT configurations.

> explain Transit Gateways and its characteristics and how its works in tabular way

Sure, here is a breakdown of the key characteristics and functionality of Transit Gateways:

```
| Component | Characteristics and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Transit Gateway | A service that simplifies network architecture by allowing you to connect multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect gateways together using a single gateway. |
| Functionality | Transit Gateway acts as a hub that connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks together using a single virtual router, simplifying network architecture and reducing the need for complex peering connections. |
| Supported Connections | Transit Gateway supports connections between VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect gateways, and allows for inter-region peering connections. |
| IP Multicast | Transit Gateway supports IP multicast, which allows a host to send a single packet to thousands of hosts across a routed network. This is useful for audio and video distribution over the internet. |
| Benefits | Transit Gateway simplifies network architecture, improves network performance, and reduces the number of peering connections required for complex architectures. |
| Limitations | Transit Gateway requires that VPCs use non-overlapping IP ranges and that Direct Connect gateways are in the same region as the Transit Gateway. |
```

It is important to understand the functionality and benefits of Transit Gateway when designing and deploying complex network architectures in AWS. Transit Gateway can simplify network topology and improve performance, and is a valuable tool for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks together.

> explain AWS VPN hub and its characteristics and how its works in tabular way

Certainly, here is a breakdown of the key characteristics and functionality of AWS VPN Hub:

```
| Component | Characteristics and Details |
| --- | --- |
| AWS VPN Hub | A solution that simplifies VPN network topology by allowing for centralized management of VPN connections between multiple sites and AWS. |
| Functionality | AWS VPN Hub allows for the creation of a central hub in AWS that can connect multiple sites via VPN tunnels. This hub can be used to manage and control traffic between the sites, and provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for managing VPN connections. |
| Supported Connections | AWS VPN Hub supports connections between multiple sites, and can connect with customer gateway devices and other VPN endpoints. |
| Security | AWS VPN Hub provides a secure and encrypted solution for managing VPN connections, and allows for the use of multiple VPN tunnels for redundancy and high availability. |
| Benefits | AWS VPN Hub simplifies VPN network topology, provides centralized management of VPN connections, and can reduce costs and complexity associated with managing multiple VPN connections. |
| Limitations | AWS VPN Hub requires that customer gateway devices support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing, and that each customer site has its own VPN connection to the VPN hub. |
```

It is important to understand the functionality and benefits of AWS VPN Hub when designing and deploying solutions that require VPN connectivity between multiple sites and AWS. AWS VPN Hub can simplify VPN network topology and reduce the complexity and costs associated with managing multiple VPN connections.
