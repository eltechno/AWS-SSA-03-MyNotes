Well, congratulations, you're at the end of the EBS section of the course. In this lecture, we're just going to review everything that we've learned in this section of the course. So let's start with EBS volumes themselves and start with SSD volumes. They're highly available and scalable storage volumes that you can attach to an EC2 instance. So we had a look at GP2, this is general purpose SSD, this is suitable for boot disks and general applications. gives you up to 16,000 IOPS per volume and it gives you up to three nines durability. Then we looked at the newer one, which is GP3. This is suitable for high performance applications and it gives you a predictable 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 megabits per second regardless of your volume size. And again, this is 99.9% durability, so three nines durability. If you need a faster SSD volumes, then we have I/O1. This is provisioned IOPS SSD. This is suitable for online transaction processing and latency sensitive applications. You get up to 50 IOPS per gig and up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. It's high performance, but it's also the most expensive EBS volume that you can get and you get three nines durability. We then have I/O2, which is the new provisioned IOPS SSD. Again, this is suitable for online transaction processing and latency sensitive applications. You get 500 IOPS per gig and about 64,000 IOPS or up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. And with I/O2, you actually get five nines durability. So it has the best durability out of any EBS volumes. And it's the latest generation provisioned IOPS volume. Moving on to our magnetic storage. So we had throughput optimized hard disk drive. This is suitable for big data, data warehouses, extract, transform and load. and the maximum throughput is 500 megabits per second and it cannot be a boot volume, but you do get up to three nines durability. We then have SC1. This has a max throughput of 250 megabits per second per volume, gives you less frequently accessed data. It cannot be a boot volume, but it is the lowest cost and it gives you three nines durability. So going on to some tips for volumes and snapshots. So just remember that volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3. And snapshots are basically like what you would do with a camera, they're a point in time photograph of a volume and they're incremental in nature. Because of this, the first snap that you will take is going to take some time to create. And for consistent snapshots, you should really stop your instance and detach the volume, that way everything is then saved to disk. You can share your snaps between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region. And you can also resize EBS volumes on the fly as well as changing the volume type. So you can go from GP2 to GP3, for example. Moving on to AMIs, and we're going to look at EBS versus Instant Store. So Instant Store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage. And you can reboot both EBS instances and Instant Store volumes, and you'll not lose your data. However, instant store volumes cannot be stopped. And we saw that in our lecture, we tried to go in and stop it, but we got that error message. So if the underlying host fails, you are going to lose your data with instant store volumes. By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with the EBS volumes, you can actually tell AWS to keep the root device volume. EBS backed instances can be stopped. So you're not going to lose any data on your instance if it is stopped. And just as a bonus tip, an AMI is just a blueprint for an EC2 instance. So have things like the architecture type, whether it's Windows or Linux, and then the instance like size, for example, et cetera, et cetera. So that's all an AMI is. Moving on to encrypted volumes. So data at rest is encrypted inside the volume. All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is going to be encrypted. All your snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted and all volumes created from your snapshots are encrypted as well. This is the really important thing to remember is how to encrypt existing root device volumes that are unencrypted. So you want to go ahead and create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume. You then create a copy of that snapshot and you select the encrypt option. You then create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot and then you use that AMI to launch a new encrypted instance. And that's what we did in our console demo. Moving on to EC2 hibernation. This is where it preserves the in-memory RAM on persistent storage. So it basically saves the RAM to disk on EBS. And it gives you much, it's basically much faster to boot up as you don't need to reload the operating system. Now your instance RAM must be less than 150 gigs and it's only available across the C, class families, the M class families, and the R class families. And it's available for Windows, Amazon Linux 2 AMI, and Ubuntu. And instances cannot be hibernated for more than 60 days. And it's available for on-demand instances and reserved instances. Moving on to EFS. So this supports the network file system version 4 or NFS v4 protocol. It can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections. You only pay for the storage that you use. You don't have to worry about pre-provisioning and starting with let's say 100 gigs, you literally just create the EFS volume like we saw in our demo and it exists straight away. And then as you add more and more files to it, it will automatically adjust, it's elastic. So the data is stored across multiple AZs within a region. It can scale up to petabytes and it has read after write consistency. Now if you have a scenario based question around highly scalable shared storage using NFS, I want you to always think of EFS. In the exam you are gonna be given different scenarios and asked to choose whether you should be using EFS, FSx for Windows or FSx for Lustre. EFS is when you need highly distributed and highly resistant storage for Linux instances and Linux based applications. Amazon FSx for Windows is when you need centralized storage for Windows-based applications. So this could be things like SharePoint, SQL Server, WorkSpaces, IIS, or any other native Microsoft application. And then Amazon FSx for Lustre is when you need high-speed, high-capacity distributed storage. And this will be for applications that do high-performance computing, financial modeling. And remember that FSx for Lustre can store data directly on S3. So just summing up and comparing all our different storage options, 'cause this is a big chunk of the exam. It's definitely gonna be 10 or 12 marks where you have to choose different storage options based on your different scenarios. So S3 is great for serverless object storage, so things like files, videos, et cetera, where you don't wanna have to manage EC2 instances. Glacier, just think of every time you hear the word archive, that's going to be a glacier question, so it's used for archiving objects. EFS is network file system or NFS for Linux instances, so it's a centralized storage solution across multiple availability zones. FSx for Lustre is file storage for high performance computing Linux file systems. EBS volumes is persistent storage for EC2 instances. And your instance store is ephemeral storage for EC2 instances. FSx for Windows is file storage for Windows instances, so it's centralized storage across multiple AZs. And like I said, if you just get a SharePoint question, I want you to think of FSx for Windows. And then finally, knowing the different use cases for the storage will gain you valuable points in the exam. And like I said, it's probably gonna be worth about 12 marks of all the different storage options. You'll be given all these different scenario questions, and then you'll have to pick which the right storage option is. And then finally, we looked at AWS backups. So going into your exam, just remember what AWS backup is. It's used for consolidations to backup your different AWS services. So this could be things like EC2, EBS, EFS, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, and AWS Storage Gateway. And essentially it's gonna give you a single pane of glass to back up all these different services. You can also use it in conjunction with AWS organizations, and this allows you to back up different AWS services across multiple AWS accounts. And just remember the benefits of AWS backup going into your exam. So it gives you centralized control, letting you automate your backups and define your lifecycle policies for your data and you get better compliance as you can enforce your backup policies, make sure they're encrypted and then audit them once they are complete. So hopefully you've learnt an awful lot in this section of the course. You've done really, really well and if you have any questions, please let me know. If not, feel free to move on to the next section. Thank you. tell you in the comments what you think.

Sure, here's a table describing the different types of EBS volumes and their use cases:


| EBS Volume Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| GP2 | General purpose SSD volume suitable for boot disks and general applications. Provides up to 16,000 IOPS per volume and up to 3 nines durability. |
| GP3 | High-performance SSD volume suitable for high-performance applications. Provides a predictable 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 megabits per second regardless of volume size. Provides 99.9% durability. |
| IO1 | Provisioned IOPS SSD volume suitable for online transaction processing and latency-sensitive applications. Provides up to 50 IOPS per gig and up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. Provides 3 nines durability. |
| IO2 | Newer provisioned IOPS SSD volume suitable for online transaction processing and latency-sensitive applications. Provides 500 IOPS per gig and up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. Provides 5 nines durability, which is the best durability out of any EBS volume. |


It's important to note that while IO1 provides the highest performance, it's also the most expensive EBS volume. GP3 provides a balance of performance and cost, while GP2 provides a good general-purpose option. IO2 provides the highest durability, making it a good choice for critical workloads.
