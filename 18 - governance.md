So let's just have a review and have some governance exam tips for you to take away. First things first, what to ask yourself in the exam. We've broken it down to four questions. And let's go over those here. First question, can it be centralized? So can we use things like AWS RAM to share resources through an org? Do we want to use Control Tower to centralize our account governance and deployments, things like that. We also want to ask how do we standardize it? So again, like Control Tower, we can leverage those guardrails to standardize our infrastructure deployments, as well as our account deployments. We also need to know how we can enforce standards that we want set. So we can use things like service control policies, AWS Config Rules, guardrails in Control Tower, and we can use CloudTrail for auditing our history of our API actions. And then lastly, are the users in question internal or external? And either way, how do we want to grant them access to resources and accounts? Now let's get a little bit more specific. First off, we'll look at AWS organizations. Remember, service control policies, or SCPs for for short, have the ultimate say as to whether an API call can go through. These are the only way you can restrict what the root account can do within your accounts. Be sure to remember that. We can also use it to centralize logs and usually centralizing your logs is usually the correct answer. CloudTrail offers support to log everything into a single account. Remember that as well. We also need to know that we can isolate workloads or groups of workloads into separate accounts. And this is a great way to add layers of security and control. It's best to break things apart and avoid lumping them all together. So use things like organizational units at a higher level to group like accounts, but keep different accounts for different purposes. So an example would be having a dev account, a test account, and maybe a product account for the same application. Now let's move on to AWS Config. The first point is standardization. Any time a rule needs to be set up for an account, think about using Config to check for compliance. We also need to know that you can automate responses. So Config offers the ability to automatically remediate problems using automation documents or Lambda functions. So while the service itself doesn't do the remediation, it just does the detection, It can trigger workloads to remediate things for you. And thirdly here, know what changed. So AWS Config is the one-stop shop to see what has changed in your account. It provides you with a history of all of your tracked architectures and resources. Now let's talk about authentication. User management requires the right tool. You need to remember that. You need to make sure you're using AWS Single Sign-On, which is moving to Identity Center now, for any internal user management, and then tend to lean toward services like Cognito for external users. Active Directory is a common topic that comes up, and anytime it does come up, you should immediately think Directory Service in AWS. If it's lift and shift, pick Manage Microsoft AD. If AD is standing on premise, it's AD Connector. These are very common scenarios that come up, So really make sure that you understand how these work. Lastly, we need to know when to leverage cross-account roles. Usually cross-account role access is always the best solution. It's way better than creating IAM users and trying to provide external users those access keys to authenticate in or even just a username and password. Anytime you can leverage a role, usually you wanna lean that way. Okay, we can move on now to cost management. Tracking costs is a very common exam topic, especially since it's one of the main pillars. You really want to use combinations of tags, cost explorer, and AWS budgets. Now you can get ahead of problems by creating proactive alerts. For instance, when users get to the 80% threshold, you can tell someone via SNS. So an example is if you set a $10 limit per month as a threshold, as soon as they hit $8 in the account, you can alert the account manager. You also want to work on automating responses. If you're spending too much money, you can probably shut something down in an automated fashion. Always think about how you can remove the human from the interaction itself. The next thing here is detailed reports and exploring costs. These questions will usually involve AWS cost and usage reports or Cost Explorer for in-depth reporting purposes. Remember, cost and usage reports are delivered daily and Cost Explorer gives you a very in-depth process of exploring those costs. And the last point here is using AWS Compute Optimizer to generate recommendations for implementing more accurately sized compute based on your actual needs. You can save a lot of money by running accurately sized compute instances instead of just guessing. Next is Trusted Advisor. Now, this is free to use, but you need a business or enterprise support plan to get the most useful checks. And there are limits to Trusted Advisor. Remember, this is strictly an auditing tool. It's not going to solve the problem for you. This is a common trap on the exam, so do not fall for it. It's only for auditing and reporting. Again, try and automate as much as you can. If you can't tell, automation is a common theme here, and that's because it's very important to try and do that as much as possible. So use things like EventBridge to maybe kick off a Lambda function to solve the problem for you. Again, remove the human interaction to speed things up. Next is accounts and licenses. AWS Control Tower can be used to implement compliance and account governance within multi-account environments using automated account setups. Within Control Tower, you can leverage Preventative or Detective guardrails. And remember, these are implemented either via SCPs for Preventative or AWS Config for Detective. and then AWS License Manager provides US service to simplify license management for supported vendors. What this does is allows you to prevent license abuse and the associated overcharges. And the cool thing about this service is it works both in AWS and on-premise. It's not just cloud specific. Next, we have infrastructure and deployments. Remember, AWS Service Catalog allows end users to provision pre-approved products and services via catalog portfolios. Now, these catalogs are written in cloud formation and deployed for them to deploy in their own accounts. And also remember, AWS Proton can empower developers to automate the provisioning of their entire application stacks for container-based or serverless architectures. It will do everything for them, ranging from the code itself, to the infrastructure, the CI/CD pipeline, and even the actual deployment. And then we have the Well-Architected tool. Remember, you use this tool to document architectural decisions and their measurements against well-established industry AWS best practices. And then the last service we want to cover is AWS Health. Remember, AWS Health is a dashboard and service meant to provide notifications of both public and account-specific events within AWS. Any questions about service alerts or notifications, especially of EC2 hardware maintenance reboots, will leverage AWS Health in some manner. And again, remember, you can automate these events using things like EventBridge and AWS Lambda. That'll do it for this Governance Exam Tips lesson. Hopefully you've learned a lot and you've now reinforced a lot. So when you're ready, we can wrap this section up and I'll see you in the next one.
