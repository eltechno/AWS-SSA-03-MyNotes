In this lesson, we're going to take a look at some exam tips for all of the automation tools that we've covered in the previous lessons. So let's go ahead and dive right on in. I have four questions here that I want you to keep in mind. And these four questions are going to apply to really every exam question that you're going to read through. The first question is, can you automate? The answer is most likely yes. If you're ever reading through a scenario and it's talking about a manual step, you should be thinking which one of my automation tools can avoid that manual procedure. Can I use cloud formation to build all the architecture? Can I use elastic beanstalk to offload all of that work of setting everything up myself? Or could I use systems manager to handle configuring the insides of my EC2 instances? kind of automation is going to work in this particular scenario. There's no one size fits all. We've kind of covered that a little bit in the previous lessons. I can't just say, Oh, this is the automation tool that I'm using in every single situation, because they all kind of have their own use case. Systems manager for the inside of those instances, elastic bean stock, really act as that one stop it shop and cloud formation to make that immutable AWS architecture that we can easily deploy and then throw away. Is the automation repeatable? It's a good question. Sometimes we can write a script or a program ourselves to do something using API calls or a CLI or an SDK, and it works. But if it's not built with one of our frameworks, sometimes it's not a repeatable situation. So while you could see the answer on the exam of, Oh, I wrote my own CLI script, we generally want to focus on answers that use one of the AWS provided frameworks, such as the few that we've gone through in this section. And then finally, would this work cross region or cross account? I've seen scenarios that say, hey, we've got a template that's working in region A, but it doesn't work in region B, or I deployed in my account, but it doesn't work in my co-workers account. How do we solve this problem? We've talked about this a little bit with not hard coding those ideas, not hard coding those values inside of my templates, but we want to keep this in mind, hard coding IDs, or even those soft limits inside of an AWS account are two of the biggest reasons that you're going to see your automation fail when it moves cross region or when it moves cross account, let's take a look at a couple of tips that are specifically cloud formation related. The first one is we really need to understand those cloud formation sections. Like I said in the cloud formation lecture, we don't have to be a coding expert. They're not going to ask you to debug in depth why this particular block of code isn't working. You're not going to have to go through the nuances of JSON versus YAML. In general, you just need to know that use case for the parameter. It's those questions that you're asking the end user who's building out the template, the mappings, how they can control or automatically fill in a value, such as what is the particular AMI that I would like to use for this region, and the resource section. The resource section is gonna contain all of the resources, right? Those instances, those networks, those databases, everything that you're trying to build out. So just keep all three of those in mind as you're looking at cloud formation questions. Immutable architecture is the best. On the exam, we like to prefer answers that include a stateless environment. Something that I can easily pick up and throw away and re-provision, it's that disposable architecture. That's what I want. We want to have automation built out that is so robust that I can turn it off, I can chuck it out the window when it's no longer needed. Now that doesn't mean that I'm proactively terminating the database every single day, 'cause obviously that wouldn't work out so well for me, but it could mean that I'm throwing away away those web servers, those back end servers, I'm hosting my data in S3 or EFS, and I'm treating that compute as something that is disposable. Now, you might run into a scenario where you're asked to deal with particular IDs. This could be an AMI ID, a snapshot ID, and remember, we never want to hard code those. So the right answer is going to be store those in the mapping section or use parameter store. Now we talked a little bit about parameter store and that systems manager lesson. Parameter store, remember, it's kind of like that universal key value storage and cloud formation can look up values that are stored in there. So mappings and parameters are an appropriate location to store those IDs. As long as we are never hard coding them directly into the resource section itself, as that's much more likely to cause that breakage when you move that template from one environment to another. Now we've got a few more tips on that Elastic Beanstalk and Systems Manager service. So we generally just need to know with Elastic Beanstalk that it's your one-stop shop for everything AWS. You're building out a web server, that's really what it excels in. If it's looking for a situation that is simple, I've seen questions that say, "Yeah, we want to make a quick migration," or "My coworkers are not interested in learning cloud formation." Well then we can focus on using elastic beanstalk over that cloud formation architecture. If the scenario is a little bit more complex, if it's talking about things like lambda functions and SQS queues and load balancers and API gateway and a little bit more robust architecture, then we'd want to think cloud formation. That gives us the most granular level of automation control over everything that we're building. Now when it comes to systems manager, those automation documents are going to be very useful to you. These automation documents can be used to configure the insides of EC2 instances, as well as parts of the AWS environment. So they're kind of the jack of all trades automation tool. Now speaking of systems manager, you don't have to dive too deeply. That's going to be featured a lot more on the SysOps exam. So in general, they want to see that you understand, "Hey, we can use automation documents to control things inside of my AWS account and inside of my EC2 instances." Potentially, you might see a question or two around storing a value in parameter store. And that session manager that we walk through in that demo might come up. However, I'd say that's pretty unlikely, but it couldn't hurt to have just a little bit of practice utilizing that tool. Alright folks, that's going to wrap it up for our automation section. Thanks for going through these exam tips with me, and I can't wait to see you in the next

> I want you to ACT AS AWS Certified solution architect and use the transcripted text as context to, check , verify and correct if its needed, the information. Also Check if it’s needed to add more topic or themes to have relevant and important information, please list all the key points to learn/remember

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I can verify that the information provided in the transcript is accurate and useful for those preparing for the AWS certification exams. The key points to remember from this lesson include:

1.  When preparing for the exams, always ask yourself if the scenario can be automated, and if so, which AWS tool is best suited for the job.
    
2.  It's important to focus on using AWS-provided frameworks instead of writing custom scripts or programs to ensure repeatability of automation.
    
3.  When dealing with particular IDs, always store them in the mapping section or use Parameter Store, and avoid hard coding them directly into the resource section.
    
4.  Immutable architecture is the best approach, with a stateless environment that can be easily provisioned, used and thrown away as necessary.
    
5.  Elastic Beanstalk is a one-stop shop for AWS, particularly for simpler web server deployments, while CloudFormation provides more granular control over complex architectures.
    
6.  Systems Manager's automation documents are useful for configuring the inside of EC2 instances and the AWS environment, and Parameter Store can be used to store values.
    

In addition to the above key points, it's important to remember to avoid hard coding values and IDs, ensure automation is repeatable, and consider cross-region and cross-account compatibility. Overall, this lesson provides valuable exam tips that will help individuals prepare for AWS certification exams and succeed in their roles as AWS Solutions Architects.
