You've made it through this section, so let's just take some time and have some serverless architecture exam tips that you can take with you into the exam. Firstly, four questions to ask yourself when you're taking the exam. The first is, is the application a right fit for containers? Or should it be hosted on something like EC2? Ask yourself, do you actually need those servers that are running your application? Or can you shift to something more serverless? Also, is the application AWS specific? And if it is, you might be able to leverage services like ECS or Lambda. And then lastly, how long does your code need to run? That's a very big tell on what AWS service you can use. So let's talk about AWS Lambda. What should you know? Well, the first thing is that Lambda loves roles. Whenever we're talking about credentials in AWS Lambda, you have to make sure you're attaching an IAM role to the function so it can perform whatever actions it needs. You need to be familiar with Lambda triggers. You're going to see questions regarding what can kick off a Lambda function. Some very popular ones are things like Amazon S3 events, Kinesis, and even EventBridge, which was formerly CloudWatch events. You also need to know Lambda's limitations. Your functions should be short and very specific. You can allocate up to 10 gigabytes of RAM, but you're limited to a 15-minute runtime window. So anything more than 15 minutes of execution is likely not a good fit for AWS Lambda. And then lastly, any AWS API call can be made. You can use any API call to kick off any vent bridge rule to perform your AWS Lambda, which can even itself trigger any vent bridge rule. It's faster than trying to look through CloudTrail and dig through whatever scenario you're trying to solve. Now we can move on to containers and images. If it's open source, think Kubernetes. If the question asks for a container management solution that can run in AWS and on-premise, you can maybe consider things like Amazon EKS or EKS Anywhere. You also need to know that Fargate cannot work alone. In order to leverage Fargate, you have to use things like Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. However, not all scenarios specify these services, but they'll try and make it sound as if Fargate is a service by itself. Containers offer flexibility. They can encompass pretty much any workload that you need to accomplish. Generally, it's preferred to use containers rather than EC2 instances on exams. You need to know the basics. So the exam might not cover containers themselves in too much depth, but it's good to know that you start with things like a Dockerfile, you build an image, you upload it to a repo or push it, and then you can run it on a host. And the last thing here is we have an AWS Managed Image Registry. If there's any mention of an AWS service needed for image storage or image vulnerability scanning, think Amazon ECR. So that wraps up containers and images. Let's look at Amazon Aurora Serverless. Remember that this is an on-demand and auto-scaling database. So questions regarding auto-scaling databases should likely involve this service. Remember, it's a perfect scenario or use for variable traffic and workloads. If you're creating a new application and you don't know the workloads or the traffic spikes for the database, this is probably a good service to include. It's also very good for capacity planning. So when questions mention things like capacity planning for a new application or even an existing one or even a development environment, then you're likely going to use this service as well. Okay, onto AWS X-Ray. Remember, this service is used to gain application insights using requests and responses of the many different services and functions at different points in your app flow. It offers you the ability to have traces and look at downstream response times. So if these terms are brought up in questions, you want to look for something involving AWS X-Ray. The service itself integrates very tightly with AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. The native integration makes it easy to gain deeper insights and understandings of your workloads requests and responses using these services. AWS AppSync, this is a short and sweet one. Just remember, this is a managed GraphQL interface. So any questions about architectures for managed GraphQL interfaces for front-end applications or developers will likely include this service. Now that'll do it. That's gonna end this overall serverless architecture exam tips lesson. When you're ready, let's go ahead and end this and move on.
