So as I mentioned at the beginning of this section, currently none of these services are on the exam. So we only covered them off at a very high level and what their use cases are. So we only have two services in the media section. So we've got Elastic Transcoder. This is where you basically convert your video files into optimized versions for particular devices. Basically I record on an iMac for example. And then when I upload this video to Elastic Transcoder, it's going to convert the video format so that you can watch on an Android device or on an iPad or something, you know, a laptop, etc. So that's all Elastic Transcoder does. It optimizes your media files for particular devices. So just remember that going into your exam. And then Amazon Kinesis video streams. So if you have a scenario-based question about video streaming at scale from millions of devices, so think Ring for example, then think of Amazon Kinesis video streams. So that is it for this section of the course guys, if you have any questions please let me know. If not feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.

Hello Cloud Gurus,

Welcome to the end of this section of the course. As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, currently none of these services are on the exam. So we only covered them at a very high level and discussed their use cases.

We only have two services in the media section: Elastic Transcoder and Amazon Kinesis video streams.

Elastic Transcoder is used to convert video files into optimized versions for specific devices. For instance, if you record a video on an iMac and upload it to Elastic Transcoder, it will convert the video format so that it can be watched on an Android device, iPad, laptop, etc. Elastic Transcoder optimizes your media files for specific devices. Keep this in mind when taking your exam.

On the other hand, if you encounter a scenario-based question about video streaming at scale from millions of devices (e.g. Ring), think of Amazon Kinesis video streams.

That concludes this section of the course. If you have any questions, please let me know. Otherwise, feel free to move on to the next lecture.

Thank you.
