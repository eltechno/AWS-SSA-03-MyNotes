Let's go ahead and take some time to have some more exam tips to help reinforce some important concepts that we've learned throughout this section. So per usual, let's start off with four questions to ask yourself in the exam. The first thing you need to be able to distinguish is are the workloads synchronous or asynchronous? This is a very critical decision as it will really decide which services you can use within the architecture itself. We then have what type of decoupling actually makes sense. Do you need things like Pub/Sub where you have an SNS topic pushing messages to several different queues? Or do you need something like a step function that has ordering of workflows to complete your workloads? We also want to ask, does the order of messages matter? So, for example, do you need a FIFO SQSQ, which is going to guarantee first in first out, or can you get away with a standard SQSQ and just handle some deduplication on the back end. We also need to ask ourselves what type of application load are we going to see? Now this is an important question, primarily because a lot of these services have limits that will also play a big part in choosing which ones you'll use in your architecture infrastructure. So let's start diving in a little bit deeper. Amazon SQS, what should we know for the exam? Well, it is important to know that SQS can duplicate messages. So in SQS standard queues, while it may only happen every once in a while, can duplicate these messages. So if it's happening pretty consistently, it's recommended you check for a misconfigured visibility timeout, or maybe a developer is failing to actually make a delete API call. So since they're failing to delete the message, it's just reappearing back on the queue. Now it's also important to know queues are not bidirectional. If you need to communicate to return to the instance that sent the message or whatever producer sent it, you need a second queue. They only go in one direction. You also need to know the defaults, so it's very important that you understand the standard values for these SQSQ settings. For instance, that visibility timeout that we talked about. Also realize that nothing lasts forever. Messages stored in SQS can only persist up to 14 days. And like some other settings, that is a configurable setting itself. And lastly, does order matter? So if message ordering is important, you need to make sure that you're selecting things like SQS FIFO queues. Okay, let's move on to Amazon SNS and API Gateway. What should you know for this exam? Well, if you need proactive notifications, think SNS. Any time a question asks about email, text, or any other type of push-based notification, you want to consider SNS. Also, CloudWatch and SNS make a perfect pair. Scenarios talking about getting notifications from CloudWatch alarms should immediately make you think and look for Amazon SNS within the answer. And then lastly, API Gateway. You really don't need an in-depth understanding as it gets very complex, but you do need to know that it acts as a secure front door for external communication coming into your environments. And that brings us to AWS Batch. For AWS Batch, you need to know that any long-running, batched workloads are a perfect use case for this service. And in our case, long-running is anything greater than 15 minutes. And that's mainly because AWS Lambda has an execution limit at 15 minutes. So while there may be ways to leverage Lambda with other services, most of the time you you want to choose the most efficient service, which in this case would be things like AWS Batch. We also want to watch for questions regarding batch workload queues. So if any of them talk about workloads requiring queues, then think about AWS Batch as well. And then lastly, this is an on-demand alternative to AWS Lambda. So if questions do ask for an alternative solution to AWS Lambda, primarily due to runtime requirements or execution timeouts, think about AWS Batch as a potential answer. On to Amazon MQ. Understand that this is a managed messaging broker service that lives within the AWS cloud. So any mention of managed broker services should likely involve Amazon MQ. It supports two different engine types, Rabbit MQ or Active MQ. Any mention of these two technologies should immediately make you think of Amazon MQ. The last big thing to look out for are specific messaging protocols. So if you see these protocols like JMS or any of the ones listed here, then Amazon MQ will likely be within the solution answer. And that's primarily because SNS and SQS cannot handle these specific messaging protocols. Now let's talk about step functions. These are a serverless orchestration service that allows you to orchestrate other AWS services in a hands-off manner. Anytime you see a requirement for workflow decision requirements, think of this service. So more specifically, if you have different states or logic during your workflows like conditional checks, failure catches, or especially wait periods. If a question talks about a lengthy wait period Up to one year, think of AWS step functions. And that brings us to Amazon Appflow. The main thing you need to know here is that this is for third party SaaS data ingestion with AWS services. So if scenarios ask about simplified data ingestion from external SaaS applications into Amazon Web Services, this is likely one of the correct solutions. Remember that it is bi-directional. So this service can either take in or put out data while it's interacting with different third-party SaaS and AWS services. A common scenario to watch for is any data being used from a third-party SaaS that needs to live within Amazon S3 on a regular basis. And that's gonna do it. That's gonna wrap up this decoupling workflows exam tips section and lesson. Let's go ahead and end here, take a break. And when you're ready, we'll pick up in the next section.
