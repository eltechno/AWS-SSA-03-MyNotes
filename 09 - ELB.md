In this lecture, we're just going to review everything that you have learned in this section of the course. So going into your exam, just remember the different elastic load balancer types. There's four, but we're just going to focus on the three that come up in the exam. So application load balancers, which is layer seven. We've got network load balancers, which are layer four. And we've got classic load balancers, which operate between layer four and layer seven. Remember what a health check is? Basically, you can use health checks to route your traffic to instances or targets that are healthy. Remember with application load balancers, just remember what a listener is. A listener checks for connection requests from clients using the protocol and the port that you configure. So it's either going to be port 80 or port 443. And then you have rules and these determine how the load balancer routes your requests to its registered target. And each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or or more conditions. And then we have our target groups. And our target groups, basically each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as our EC2 instances, using the protocol and port numbers that you specify. Remember that there is a limitation to application load balancers. It does only support HTTP and HTTPS. And to use a HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least one SSL or TLS server certificate on your load balancer. And the load balancer uses the service certificate to terminate the front end connection and decrypt the request from your clients before sending them to the targets. Moving on to network load balancers, remember they operate at layer four, you're going to use them when you need extreme performance. Other use cases are where you need protocols that are not supported by application load balancers. And network load balancers can also decrypt your traffic, but you're going to need to install this certificate Moving on to classic load balancers, remember what a 504 error means? It just means that the gateway has timed out and this means your application is not responding within the idle timeout period. And to basically solve this, you just need to troubleshoot the application. Is your web server down or is it your database server, etc? And remember if you need the IPv4 address of your end user, you're going to be looking for the x forwarded for header. Moving on to sticky sessions. So just remember what sticky sessions are, they enable your users to stick to the same EC2 instance. And this can be useful if you're storing information locally to that instance. And you may see scenario-based questions where you remove an EC2 instance from a pool, but the load balancer continues to direct traffic to that EC2 instance. In a scenario like that, you just need to disable sticky sessions. Remember that application load balancers also have sticky sessions, so you can enable sticky sessions for your application load balancer, but it's going to be sent to the target group level, not to the individual EC2 instances. In that target group, if you do want it to go to individual EC2 instances, then you basically just need one target group per EC2 instance. Also remember, deregistration delay or connection draining, depending on if it's an application load balancer or a classic load balancer, they're exactly the same thing. So you basically want to enable deregistration delay and this will keep existing connections open if the EC2 instance becomes unhealthy. Or you could choose to disable deregistration delay or connection draining and you do this if you want your load balancer to immediately close connections to the instances that are deregistered or that have become unhealthy. So that is it for this lecture and this is the end of the load balancing section. So if you got the time, I'll see you in the next section.

> explain in tabular way, different types of load balancers, such as application, network, and classic, and how to configure them for optimal performance.

Sure, here is a table that explains the different types of load balancers and how to configure them for optimal performance:

```
| Load Balancer Type | Description | Configuration for Optimal Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application Load Balancer (ALB) | Operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model and is designed to handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It can route requests to different target groups based on the content of the request. | Configure listener rules to route traffic to different target groups based on the path, host, or query string of the request. Use target groups to distribute traffic to EC2 instances or other targets, such as containers or IP addresses. |
| Network Load Balancer (NLB) | Operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model and is designed to handle TCP/UDP traffic. It can handle millions of requests per second with low latency. | Configure listeners to listen for incoming traffic on a specific port or range of ports. Use target groups to distribute traffic to EC2 instances or other targets, such as containers or IP addresses. |
| Classic Load Balancer (CLB) | Operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7 of the OSI model and is designed to handle HTTP/HTTPS and TCP/UDP traffic. It is the oldest type of load balancer on AWS and is still supported but not recommended for new deployments. | Configure listeners to listen for incoming traffic on a specific port or range of ports. Use backend servers to distribute traffic to EC2 instances or other targets. |
```

To configure these load balancers for optimal performance, it is important to follow AWS best practices for load balancing, such as:

*   Distributing traffic evenly across all healthy instances or targets
*   Monitoring the health of instances or targets using health checks and replacing unhealthy instances or targets automatically
*   Optimizing SSL/TLS encryption and decryption for HTTPS traffic
*   Configuring sticky sessions for applications that require it
*   Using Auto Scaling to automatically scale the number of instances or targets in response to changes in demand

By following these best practices and configuring load balancers appropriately, you can ensure that your applications are highly available, scalable, and performant on AWS.
