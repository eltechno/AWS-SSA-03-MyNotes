Before we move on, let's have a quick exam tips section for you to take with you into your exam. So first things first, four questions that you want to ask yourself in the exam. The first is, what is the best tool to monitor with? Is it an AWS service? Or is it maybe something that's third party related that would be a better fit? It's really going to come down to your use case and specific keywords and scenarios you want to look out for. Also, is that metric available by default? And if it's not, how can we create a custom metric to look out for? And thirdly, where can I actually find the logs? Are we going to just store them like application logs in a log stream and log group? Or are we going to centralize them like CloudTrail logs in an S3 bucket somewhere else? And then the last thing here is, do I need to adjust by alarm threshold. So maybe you have a scenario where your auto scaling group is not actually properly auto scaling your EC2 instances. Well, maybe you need to adjust your threshold for it to actually alarm and trigger an action. Now let's have a quick CloudWatch overview. What should you know for the exam? Well, CloudWatch is the main tool for anything alarm related. You leverage it to trigger alarms, and then you can tie in other services to go ahead and action on those alarms. So maybe SNS, for example, to alert teams, or maybe you want to trigger some type of run command in an action for an EC2 instance. Now, not everything should go through CloudWatch. We'll discuss some other specific tools in future sections, but a key difference to look out for is for AWS standards that really should be watched by AWS Config. So you may get scenarios talking about watching for resource changes, and that would likely go through config as opposed to anything related to CloudWatch. You also need to know your intervals. So a standard metric is delivered every five minutes. However, detailed monitoring delivers data every one minute. However, the detailed monitoring is not standard. So please understand that. With that, let's move on to application monitoring with CloudWatch logs. Again, understand CloudWatch logs is the place for logging. It's very important to know that EC2, on-premise, RDS, Lambda, and even CloudTrail can integrate with this service. So you can literally push any logs from on-premise to CloudWatch logs as long as it has the proper permission to do so. Now, if anything comes up related to SQL and logs, you might want to think about CloudWatch logs insights. Now you don't need to know this service in depth. However, it's just a good idea to have a high level of understanding of what this service does. And then the last point here is anything real time related is going to mean Kinesis. So we're going to cover this service later in our big data section. But for now, just understand you need to avoid picking CloudWatch logs if it asks for something in real time. So if it's a real time logging service that's required, think Kinesis over CloudWatch. With that, let's move on to the next one, visualizing data and monitoring containers at scale. Grafana might be the best for visualization of container metrics. If a scenario brings up an AWS managed service for correlation and visualization of container or internet of things metrics, you might want to think about Grafana. Now, if you're monitoring those container metrics at scale, you also want to think about Amazon managed service for Prometheus. You will likely leverage this service for any Kubernetes based metrics monitoring at scale. And remember, it can be an Amazon EKS cluster or even your own self-managed clusters. It's also important to know these are both managed services. So what does that mean? Well, AWS is going to handle the scaling and the high availability for you. So if you have any scenarios talking about these open source technologies, but wanting to leverage AWS or some type of managed service instead of self-managing them, these may be the best services to look for. Now that'll do it for the Monitoring Exam Tips lesson. We'll go ahead and end this and when you're ready, we'll pick up in the next one.

> now i want to use that text and I want you to act as a AWS Certified solution architect and that information about the certification's material for AWS Solution Architect Associated certification, check,verify and correct, the information if itâ€™s necessary to have relevant and important information. If there is any information missing, add all necessary material to improve the study information, please list all the key points to lear/remember

Sure, let me review the text and provide feedback as an AWS Certified Solution Architect for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification.

The text provides a good overview of monitoring in AWS, which is a key topic covered in the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. The text covers important topics such as CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, and Grafana, which are commonly used monitoring tools in AWS.

Here are some key points to remember for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification:

1.  CloudWatch is the main tool for anything alarm related in AWS. It can be used to trigger alarms and tie in other services to take action.
    
2.  CloudWatch logs is the place for logging in AWS. It can be used to store logs from EC2, on-premise, RDS, Lambda, and CloudTrail.
    
3.  AWS Config is another tool that is commonly used for monitoring in AWS. It is used to monitor resource changes and enforce compliance rules.
    
4.  Detailed monitoring in AWS delivers data every one minute, while standard monitoring delivers data every five minutes.
    
5.  Grafana is a commonly used tool for visualizing container metrics in AWS.
    
6.  Amazon managed service for Prometheus is used for Kubernetes-based metrics monitoring at scale.
    
7.  Kinesis is used for real-time logging in AWS and should be used instead of CloudWatch logs for real-time logging.
    

Overall, the text provides a good overview of monitoring in AWS, which is an important topic covered in the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. It is important to have a good understanding of CloudWatch, CloudWatch logs, and other monitoring tools in order to successfully pass the certification.
