> ACT AS a profesional writter and transcribe, fix the identation the following text: Okay, hello Cloud Gurus and congratulations, you're at the end of the machine learning section of the course. Now when we started this section of the course, I said very few of these services are currently on the exam. That is still the case. The two services that are covered is Recognition and Amazon SageMaker. So you will see those on the exam, but essentially you just need to know what they are and when you would use them. So let's quickly go through all the topics that we've learned. So comprehend, this is a speech to text service. It's used for sentiment analysis. So it's commonly used around elections, for example, or if a company wants to know if someone is saying good or bad things about them on Twitter. It's also used to index and search product reviews. You can use it for legal brief management or to process financial documents. What about Kendra? When do you use Kendra? Well, this is if you have a scenario question about using machine learning to build an intelligent search service using unstructured text. So a good example of this would be where you've got a whole bunch of scientists who have research papers that are stored across S3 buckets, file servers, it could be databases, could be anywhere basically, and you need one service to allow them to search for that information, you need to build an intelligent search service, then that is where you're going to be using Amazon Kendra. Moving on to Textract, This is basically where you convert text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents into text. So think of it basically as optical character recognition. If you have a scenario-based question where you need to analyze time series data and make predictions based on that analysis, then you want to use Amazon Forecast. So this could be, again, temperature sensors at weather stations all around the world, and you wanna predict temperatures based on previous data. Then you want to go ahead and use Amazon Forecast. Moving on to fraud detector. Basically, if you have a scenario where you're asked to build a fraud detection machine learning model that's highly customizable based on your data, then you want Amazon Fraud Detection Service. So Amazon Fraud Detector. Where would you use Transcribe? Well, Transcribe if you remember from our Alexa lecture, if you see a scenario where basically you need to use machine learning to convert video and audio into text. For example, closed captioning, think of transcribe. And so this is what's happening when you're talking to Alexa. It's basically recording your audio, converting that into text, and then it is sending it on to Lex. So if you have a scenario based question where you need to build conversational chatbots, I want you to think of Amazon Lex, and this is the service that powers the logic behind Alexa. You also would use it when you go onto Bank of America or American Airlines or anything where it has automated chatbots, you're probably using Lex on the back end. And then we have Polly and Polly converts text into natural speech in multiple languages. And Polly is the service that allows Alexa to speak back to you, to answer you. In terms of recognition, this definitely a hundred percent comes up in the exam. So if you have a scenario question about content moderation using AI/ML, you might have a social media application, for example, and you want to make sure nobody uploads anything rude to it, I want you to think of Amazon Recognition. Then we went into SageMaker. It did get a little bit complex. If you want to learn about AI and ML in more detail, we have a whole bunch of courses on it, including there's a specialty certification. I would recommend checking it out. Really, you need to go in just knowing that you have notebooks. So this is where you can go ahead and basically use Jupyter notebooks in the AWS cloud environment. You can use SageMaker for training. This is where you train and tune your models. And then inference is where you package and deploy your models as well. I haven't left out ground truth deliberately, but it just doesn't really come up in the exam. But this is where you can set up and manage labeling jobs for training data sets using active learning and human labeling. So in terms of the stages, basically go in, create a model, you create an endpoint configuration, and then you create your endpoint. If you get a scenario question where it's talking about using something like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you've created your own customized machine learning algorithm and you load it into SageMaker and you need to optimize this for a particular type of chip architecture such as Nvidia or ARM or Intel or whatever, then you want SageMaker Neo. So SageMaker Neo will basically create an optimized binary and then that machine learning model will run very well on the particular hardware that you specify. Going into the exam, just remember you've got elastic inference. You use this basically to reduce costs. So you're using CPU based inferences rather than GPU based inferences. You just need to remember the difference. But if you see a scenario question where it's talking about reducing cost, you want to use elastic inference. Remember that SageMaker comes with automatic scaling and you you can also have high availability with SageMaker as well. And then finally, we have translate. So if you have a scenario based question, we need to translate languages from one language to another using deep learning or neural networks. I want you to think of translate. So don't freak out too much machine learning. It just is this on the exam blueprint in a lot of detail. But when you actually go in and do the exam, really you just need to know what recognition and SageMaker are and that's it. So if you have any questions, please let me know. If not, feel free to move on to the next section.

Recommendations to Study:

For those preparing for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification, it is important to have a solid understanding of AWS machine learning services and their use cases. In addition to reviewing the information provided in the transcript, I recommend studying the AWS documentation for each service covered in the table above, as well as practicing with sample exam questions to familiarize yourself with the exam format and types of questions you may encounter. The AWS training and certification website offers a range of resources, including free and paid courses, practice exams, and whitepapers that can be helpful in preparing for the certification exam. It is also important to have hands-on experience with AWS services, so consider setting up a free tier AWS account and experimenting with the machine learning services covered in this lesson.
